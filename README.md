# The Problem

In 1976, Sri Lanka had just $2 billion in loans. Now, 43 years later, it has over $60 billion in loans. Why? Because we voted for parties consisting of the same crooks led by different leaders. We can continue to vote for UNP, SLPP, or any other political party, it will make no difference. Any leader claiming he can recover the economy is lying to the people and to himself. Do understand, there is no light at the end of this tunnel. The nation will inevitably be on life support.

Wealth inequality, the gap between the rich and poor, has reached the highest point in the history of Sri Lanka. The elites of Sri Lanka are unbelievably wealthy. How? Because 22 million people have been exploited as cheap labour for several generations. Our natural resources have been sold for their personal profits. Our nation’s geographical location abused to borrow in excess, much of which went to their pockets.

The under-development of Sri Lanka is, was, and will be intentional, to keep the poor, middle, and working class in a state of busy. A busy that prevents revolution, justice, and collective action. A busy that makes us powerless, divided, and respectful of masters who disrespect us in broad daylight. There is no point in pointing fingers at the elite's network of organized groups, media outlets, corporations, politicans, government officials or the system as a whole. If change is to come, we must change ourselves first.

# The Proposal

We propose the formation of Ravana Party (RP), Ravana Elders Working Committee (REWC), and Ravana Youth Working Committee (RYWC). Both the political front & working committees will be transparent, open, internet-based, and collaborative in nature, for others to follow, discuss, review, criticize, and make recommendations to facilitate the drafting of policies, electing of candidates, organizing of campaigns, and to be involved in the politics of Sri Lanka.

The concept of citizenry working committees that retain ownership of a political front, with rights to govern, dismiss & appoint members of the political party, will be a first in world history, and serves to keep politicans more accountable and within their limits. The public doesn't elect representatives anymore, they elect political parties, and so what we are proposing is in line with todays reality.

# The Acts

Upon year 2024, we shall prepare for the worst, an economic collapse and skyrocketing food prices. The laws we propose can recoup billions of rupees yearly, which can bail out one government sector at a time. First, the agriculture, food & water related industries. We must become self-sufficient in feeding our people. We shall leave no arable land under-utilized. The results, if successful, will be equivalent to doubling our garment industry. Then, Sri Lanka would be positioned to bail out other industries such as health & education. But first, we must recover state assets that were misappropriated over decades.
